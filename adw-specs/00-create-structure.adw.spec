### React Component Library: FlaggedCsvComponent

We will build a React Component which, takes a flagged csv as input, can draw a nice, modern tailwindcss table that renders an Excel like table. The table should favour all elements of the special flags of the input flagged csv, including background colors and cell merge.

Read `./flagged-csv.prompt.md` for the Flagged CSV syntax.

Note you should find a good way to pass the input flagged csv as a string. 

A sample flagged csv file is `./flagged.csv`
